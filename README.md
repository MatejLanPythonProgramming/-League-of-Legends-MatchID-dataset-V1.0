# -League-of-Legends-MatchID-dataset-V1.0
A python program, that gathers all match IDs from starter player, searches all matches and gathers all players. If you really need a lot of match IDs it can search for every found player all his matches and so on and so on. Code is far from perfect as I am a python beginner.
