# League-of-Legends-MatchID-dataset-V1.0
A python program, that gathers all match IDs from starter player, searches all matches and gathers all players. If you really need a lot of match IDs it can search for every found player all his matches and so on and so on. Code is far from perfect as I am a python beginner.

# How to use
1. Install python 3.x
2. Install requests using pip.
3. Open main.py and enter your summoner_name, server and API key, which you can fing here:https://developer.riotgames.com/
4. Start the program and enyoj your IDs.
